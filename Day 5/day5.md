### Day 5: Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
1. **Return a promise that resolves after a delay:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs "Resolved after 1 second" after 1 second.
   ```

2. **Fetch data from a public API:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the fetched data from the API to the console.
   ```

3. **Handle multiple promises with `Promise.all()`:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the data from both API calls as an array.
   ```

4. **Fetch user data and handle errors:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the user data or an error message if fetching fails.
   ```

5. **Fetch and display data using `async/await`:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the fetched data from the API.
   ```

6. **Retry fetching data upon failure:**  
   ```javascript
   // Retries the fetch operation and logs the result or error message.
   ```

7. **Create a timeout using promises:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs "Timeout completed" after 2 seconds.
   ```

8. **Resolve a promise after a random time:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs "Resolved after random delay" after a random delay (up to 3 seconds).
   ```

9. **Load multiple images using promises:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the URLs of successfully loaded images or errors for failed loads.
   ```

10. **Display a loading spinner during API requests:**  
    ```javascript
    // Shows a spinner during the API request and hides it afterward.
    ```
