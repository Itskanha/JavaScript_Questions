### Day 3: Event Handling
1. **Listen for click events on a button:**  
   ```javascript
   // Click event handler will show an alert when the button is clicked.
   ```

2. **Change background color of a div on hover:**  
   ```javascript
   // The div's background will change to yellow on mouse enter.
   ```

3. **Debounce an event handler:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs "Window resized" after resizing stops for 300ms.
   ```

4. **Log mouse coordinates on mouse move:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs current mouse coordinates as you move the mouse.
   ```

5. **Toggle a class on an element when clicked:**  
   ```javascript
   // The class 'active' will be toggled on the div when the button is clicked.
   ```

6. **Stop event propagation:**  
   ```javascript
   // Only the child click event will trigger an alert, not the parent.
   ```

7. **Create and dispatch a custom event:**  
   ```javascript
   // Dispatches a custom event that can be listened to elsewhere in the code.
   ```

8. **Handle keyboard events and log the key pressed:**  
   ```javascript
   // Logs the key pressed to the console.
   ```

9. **Change text when a button is pressed:**  
   ```javascript
   // Changes the text of the specified element when the button is clicked.
   ```

10. **Display a message after a delay when an input field is focused:**  
    ```javascript
    // Alerts "Input focused!" after 2 seconds when the input is focused.
    ```
